## Description

A User and Content management system that leverages authentication to make sure that only a logged in person can edit site contents.

1. When not logged in, user list and content editing is not available. Try going to the "View Registered Users" and "Content" pages through the hamburger menu to verify this.
2. In order to log in, you first need to register. Go to the Register page through the hamburger menu and enter your desired credentials.
3. Head back to the home page to sign in with the new credentials. You will be shown a list of Registered Users, where each user can be modified or deleted.
4. Head to the Content page next, where games can now be modified or deleted too!

That sums up this project, it is meant to be a quick demo of working user authentication using PHP.
